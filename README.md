# Step 3

## What is Step 3?

Twelve-step programs are mutual-aid networks to help addicts achieve sobriety.
An agnostic version of step 3 could read like:
> Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over the care of our higher power.

## `step3.pdf`

Step 3 was difficult for me to wrap my head around.
One resource in particular that 
was critical in developing my understanding was [`step3.pdf`](https://emotionalsobrietyandfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/step3.pdf).
This document was made available to the community by 
Shira of the ["Emotional Sobriety and Food" blog](https://emotionalsobrietyandfood.com),
and it reflects communal wisdom built over many years.
I am re-distributing the original pdf in this repository to help share it, 
and provide redundancy against the changing landscape of the internet.

## `step3_classic.tex` and `step3_classic_v1.pdf`
Given that the original document was a pdf without source, 
I recreated it as best I could in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).
In this way, I hope to make it easier for future readers 
to modify and share the message of this document.
This is not a pixel-perfect match of the original, but
my intent is for the language to match exactly.

## `step3_sbft.tex` and `step3_sbft_v1.pdf`
My home group is a free-thought group, we do not endorse any form of religion or atheism.
Our primary purpose to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
As such, I wanted to adapt the original document to match the language of my home group as well as my own experience.
There are some subtle changes, like replacing "God" with "Higher Power"
and updating pronouns. 
The largest change is the removal of the original "Pray" section with a new "Practice Willingness" section.
